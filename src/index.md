# Work experience
Lemonade stand
I built my bracket with wood, nails, and a hammer. My family SquarePants has a secret lemonade recipe that has been passed down from generation to generation I
used that recipe to make the lemonade. Then I sold it with my friend Patrick Star.
Sell chocolate
I bought a lot of chocolate, and I sold the chocolate from door to door,especially for the elderly with my friend Patrick Star.
